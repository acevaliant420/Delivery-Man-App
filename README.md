To test Selenium in your project, you typically create Python scripts that use Selenium WebDriver to automate interactions with your web application. These scripts simulate user interactions such as clicking buttons, filling out forms, and verifying elements on the page.

Frontend web pages of our system of apps are rigorously tested using Selenium to ensure functionality, responsiveness, and user experience across different browsers and devices.

To see all the test scripts go to each app and you will find test scripts under the folder named "Testing"
